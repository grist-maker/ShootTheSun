# ShootTheSun
A 2-week 5-student rapid prototype developed over 3 weeks for mobile platforms. In this game demonstrating arcady, push-your-luck fun, the player controls a rocket on its way to the sun. Asteroids in the way are obstacles, but also your saving grace - they cast shadows that you can hide behind, preventing you from over-heating.
